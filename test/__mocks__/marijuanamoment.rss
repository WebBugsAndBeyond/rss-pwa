            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marijuana users have “superior performance across multiple cognitive domains,&#8221; according to a new large-scale study funded by the U.S. federal government, with the effects of cannabis on cognition &#8220;presented concurrently across a range of brain systems.”</p>
<p>The research, published this month as a preprint by Nature Portfolio, analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from 37,929 participants in the United Kingdom aged between 44 and 81 years old. The team found that cannabis consumers consistently outperformed non-users on a range of cognitive tests—suggesting that marijuana use may be linked to brain network patterns typically observed in younger individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest that cannabis use may be associated with a deceleration of neural aging processes and the preservation of cognitive function in older adults,&#8221; the paper says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We speculate that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may exert neuroprotective effects during aging by preserving an optimal balance between functional segregation and integration—an essential feature for maintaining specialized processing and efficient information transfer across brain networks,&#8221; wrote the researchers, who are from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, Georgia State University, University of Colorado, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science.</p>
<p>The authors of the <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6977015/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, which was supported by National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants, noted that as marijuana laws evolve and societal attitudes shift, researchers are uncovering a more complex picture of the drug’s effects, particularly among older adults.</p>
<p>Legalization, increased permissiveness, and recognition of therapeutic potential have contributed to a marked rise in marijuana consumption among the study population, the authors said. They pointed out that older adults now represent the fastest-growing group of cannabis users, increasingly using it to manage chronic physical and mental health conditions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Cannabis users exhibited superior performance across multiple cognitive domains.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The brain undergoes significant physiological changes with age, and the study underscored the importance of understanding how cannabis interacts with these processes.  The researchers cautioned, however, that “the effects of marijuana in older adults may differ significantly from those observed in younger populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address gaps in previous research around marijuana’s effects on aging, the research team utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques on a vast dataset, which included brain scans and cognitive assessments from tens of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank.</p>
<p>The data revealed that cannabis users demonstrated brain network “characteristics typically associated with younger brains, along with enhanced cognitive abilities, highlighting a potential modulatory role for cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in neurodegenerative processes,” potentially supporting cognitive resilience. These benefits were noted from midlife into the late 60s and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannabis use may confer neurocognitive benefits in older adults by modulating the organization of functional brain networks,&#8221; they speculated. &#8220;The observed effects imply that cannabinoids may exert neuroprotective influences in aging populations, potentially through their regulatory roles in maintaining or enhancing functional brain segregation and integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study’s large scale has the potential to make it a landmark contribution to the field of marijuana and aging research, though the team emphasized that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play.</p>
<p>Relatedly, a study published last year found that marijuana use is associated with lower odds of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with people who consume cannabis for recreational or medical purposes <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-consumers-have-significantly-decreased-odds-of-cognitive-decline-study-finds/">reporting less confusion and memory loss compared to non-users</a>.</p>
<p>A separate study in 2023 examining marijuana’s neurocognitive effects found that “<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/study-finds-no-evidence-that-medical-marijuana-causes-cognitive-impairment-in-patients-with-chronic-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prescribed medical cannabis may have minimal acute impact on cognitive function</a> among patients with chronic health conditions.”</p>
<p>While the long-term effects of cannabis use are far from settled science, findings from a number of recent studies suggest some fears have been overblown.</p>
<p>A report published in April that drew on dispensary data, for instance, found that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-helps-cancer-patients-think-more-clearly-and-manage-pain-study-using-cannabis-from-dispensaries-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">cancer patients reported being able to think more clearly when using medical marijuana</a>. They also said it helped manage pain.</p>
<p>A separate study of teens and young adults at risk of developing psychotic disorders found that regular <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/young-people-at-risk-of-psychosis-saw-symptoms-surprisingly-improve-with-marijuana-use-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">marijuana use over a two-year period did not trigger early onset of psychosis symptoms</a>—contrary to the claims of prohibitionists who argue that cannabis causes mental illness. In fact, it was associated with modest improvements in cognitive functioning and reduced use of other medications.</p>
<p>Yet another study published by the American Medical Association (AMA) last year that looked at data from more than 63 million health insurance beneficiaries determined that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-legalization-not-associated-with-increased-rates-of-psychosis-american-medical-association-study-of-63-million-people-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">there’s “no statistically significant increase” in psychosis-related diagnoses</a> in states that have legalized marijuana compared to those that continue to criminalize cannabis.</p>
<p>Studies from 2018, meanwhile, found that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/smoking-marijuana-actually-improves-working-memory-study-indicates/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">marijuana may actually increase working memory</a> and that cannabis use <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-use-doesnt-actually-change-the-structure-of-your-brain-new-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">doesn’t actually change the structure of the brain</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Mississippi has an opportunity to lead the South and the nation in pioneering a new path toward evidence-based, life-saving care.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>By Rep. Sam J. Creekmore IV, Chairman, Mississippi House Public Health and Human Services Committee</p>
<p>On August 28 at 10:00 a.m., the Mississippi Legislature will hold a joint House and Senate <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/mississippi-lawmakers-schedule-hearing-on-ibogaine-therapy-as-gop-chairman-crafts-psychedelics-bill-for-next-session/">hearing at the Capitol to explore the clinical potential of ibogaine</a>, a promising therapy for addiction and PTSD. Exploration of a promising treatment is a critical step forward in our commitment to not just talk about the crisis our veterans and communities face, but to take meaningful, evidence-backed action.</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of Mississippi veterans return home carrying invisible wounds: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), moral injury, chronic pain, and addiction. Too often, instead of healing, they receive sedation.</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs spends nearly $1 billion annually on psychiatric and pain medications, which are now widely known as “combat cocktails.” These regimens often involve overlapping prescriptions of antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, opioids, and sleep aids, typically administered without a coordinated treatment plan.</p>
<p>A recent investigation by the Wall Street Journal revealed the tragic consequences of this approach. The article detailed how veterans are being prescribed complex drug combinations that frequently dull cognition, compound mental health challenges and, rather than reducing risk, may increase the likelihood of suicide. As many as 1 in 3 veterans with PTSD are prescribed five or more psychiatric drugs at once, with no meaningful improvement in outcomes.</p>
<p>This is not healing. It’s dependency.</p>
<p>Rather than restoring quality of life, this pharmaceutical overload fuels a worsening crisis: More than 6,000 veterans die by suicide each year, including 60 to 65 Mississippians. Countless others suffer in silence, trapped between failed drug regimens and a lack of real alternatives.</p>
<p>This is more than a medical failure. It’s a policy failure and one we can change.</p>
<p>That path forward begins with ibogaine, a plant-derived compound with extraordinary potential in treating opioid addiction, PTSD, and trauma-related disorders. In supervised clinical settings abroad, ibogaine treatment shows short-term success rates up to 80 percent and long-term rates of 50–70 percent results far superior to what current therapies offer.</p>
<p>And it’s not just anecdotal.</p>
<p>In 2024, Stanford University’s School of Medicine published a groundbreaking study following U.S. Special Operations veterans.</p>
<p>It documented “large, rapid, and sustained reductions” in PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation after a single dose of ibogaine.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS) has helped more than 1,300 U.S. veterans receive ibogaine therapy outside the country. As Navy SEAL and VETS co-founder Marcus Capone put it: “Ibogaine saved my life. I tried everything available in the U.S. Nothing worked until this.”</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Our veterans shouldn’t have to leave the country or break the law to find healing. They shouldn’t have to choose between silence and suicide.</p>
<p>The same holds for the broader public. In 2021, 556 Mississippians died from opioid overdoses 71 percent of all drug-related deaths. Overdose rates among people under 35 increased by 158 percent between 2019 and 2021. The cost to our state in both lives and dollars is staggering. Every life lost is a tragedy and every dollar spent without meaningful impact is a failure of policy.</p>
<p>And yet, conventional treatments continue to fail. Nationally, relapse rates for opioid addiction remain between 60–90 percent within one year. Instead of innovation, we offer incarceration. Instead of healing, we extend prescriptions. It is unsustainable and unconscionable.</p>
<p>Conservative principles must step in.</p>
<p>We believe in individual freedom, limited government, fiscal responsibility, and innovation through public-private partnerships. Supporting ibogaine research honors every one of those values.</p>
<p>Mississippi has an opportunity to lead the South and the nation in pioneering a new path toward evidence-based, life-saving care.</p>
<p>Just look at Texas. On June 11, 2025, Governor Greg Abbott (R) signed Senate Bill 2308, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/texas-governor-signs-bill-to-create-ibogaine-research-consortium-aiming-to-develop-fda-approved-psychedelic-drug/">allocating $50 million in state funds toward ibogaine clinical trials</a>. Texas formed a consortium of universities, hospitals, and biotech firms, retaining commercial rights to any resulting treatments. Twenty-five percent of royalties go directly to veteran support programs.</p>
<p>This collaboration is innovative. It’s bold. And it is what leadership looks like.</p>
<p>Mississippi should do the same. We should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support ibogaine clinical trials with university and health system partners;</li>
<li>Demand federal reclassification of ibogaine to allow research and treatment;</li>
<li>Expand Right to Try access for veterans and civilians with treatment-resistant conditions; and</li>
<li>Reject the false binary of pills or prison for those suffering from addiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>We already passed a Right to Try law for terminally ill patients. If we believe in that freedom for cancer, we should offer the same dignity and choice to those fighting for their lives against PTSD and addiction.</p>
<p>The current system $1 billion in drug cocktails, tens of thousands of suicides is a dead end. We can and must do better.</p>
<p>Let’s be bold. Let’s be early. Let’s lead.</p>
<p>Join us on August 28. Let’s give our veterans and communities something more potent than another prescription: a real chance at recovery.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump says his administration is &#8220;looking at&#8221; a proposal to reschedule marijuana and will &#8220;make a determination over the next few weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about recent reporting that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-says-hes-going-to-look-at-marijuana-as-white-house-chief-of-staff-receives-rescheduling-reports/">the administration is considering the Biden administration-initiated plan to move cannabis</a> from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Trump said during a White House press conference on Monday that we&#8217;re &#8220;only looking at that&#8221; and it&#8217;s too &#8220;early&#8221; to say how the issue will be decided, adding that &#8220;it&#8217;s a very complicated subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people like it. Some people hate it—people hate the whole concept of marijuana, because it does bad for the children [and] it does bad for people that are older than children,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re looking at reclassification, and we&#8217;ll make a determination over the next few weeks—and that determination, hopefully, will be the right one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump endorsed rescheduling during last year&#8217;s presidential campaign, but he appeared less willing to embrace the reform from the podium during the press conference on Monday, which focused on federal intervention to address crime in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard great things having to do with medical [cannabis], and I&#8217;ve heard bad things having to do with just about everything else,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;But medical, for pain and various things, I&#8217;ve heard some pretty good things—but for other things, I&#8217;ve heard some pretty bad things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1954928772991291413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While Trump back rescheduling—as well as industry banking access and a Florida marijuana legalization ballot initiative—on the campaign trail, Monday&#8217;s presser marks the first time he&#8217;s spoken publicly about the issue since taking office.</p>
<p>CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported late last week that the president told donors at a recent event that “we need to look at” rescheduling.</p>
<p>Kim Rivers, CEO of the major marijuana company Trulieve, was in attendance at the dinner where Trump briefly discussed marijuana this month, the Journal reported.</p>
<p>According to CNN, there is dissent within the administration when it comes to cannabis, with some advisors urging the president to take action on the popular campaign pledge and others “cautioning that the moral and legal ramifications of loosening marijuana restrictions could outweigh the potential gains and even backfire politically.”</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has requested key agencies to submit their positions on cannabis rescheduling, with CNN citing two sources who said those responses “now sit in a report on her desk” after having been compiled by the Domestic Policy Council.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new political committee that shares the same treasurer as Trump’s own super PAC is <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-should-reschedule-marijuana-says-ad-from-new-political-committee-that-shares-same-treasurer-as-presidents-maga-super-pac/">pushing the president to follow through on rescheduling marijuana</a>, releasing an ad that highlights his previous endorsement of the reform on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>The treasurer of the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00906701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAC</a>, Charles Gantt, is the same person named as treasurer of Trump’s political committee, MAGA Inc., which <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-industry-political-committee-donated-1-million-to-trumps-pac-new-fec-filings-show/">recently reported receiving $1 million from a marijuana industry PAC</a> that’s supported by multiple major cannabis companies.</p>
<p>That committee, the American Rights and Reform PAC, separately released ads in May that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-industry-pac-attacks-biden-and-canada-in-new-ads-designed-to-appeal-to-trump/">attacked former President Joe Biden’s marijuana policy record</a> in an apparent attempt to push Trump to go further on the issue.</p>
<p>Separately, a post that recently circulated on social media appears to show that MAGA Inc., which is also referred to as also called Make America Great Again Inc., itself created an ad that touts Trump’s support for “commonsense reform” such as removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and letting states set their own policies.</p>
<p>The ad ends with the narrator saying “Donald Trump for president,” however, indicating that it may have been prepared prior to the 2024 election.</p>
<p>The owner of the major gardening supply company Scotts Miracle-Gro recently said Trump has told him directly “multiple times” since taking office that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-privately-committed-to-reschedule-marijuana-multiple-times-since-taking-office-ceo-says/">he intends to see through the marijuana rescheduling process</a>.</p>
<p>Trump’s former acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) also recently predicted that the administration <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-former-dea-head-predicts-president-will-dig-in-to-marijuana-laws-and-figure-out-best-way-forward/">will soon “dig in” to the state-federal marijuana policy conflict</a>, emphasizing the need to “eliminate confusion, not create it” amid the rescheduling push.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Terrence Cole, who was sworn in last month as the new administrator of the DEA, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-rescheduling-not-included-in-new-dea-heads-strategic-priorities-despite-pledge-during-confirmation-hearing/">declined to include rescheduling on a list of “strategic priorities”</a> the agency that instead focused on anti-trafficking enforcement, Mexican cartels, the fentanyl supply chain, drug-fueled violence, cryptocurrency, the dark web and a host of other matters.</p>
<p>That’s despite the fact that Cole said during a confirmation hearing in April that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pick-to-lead-dea-says-marijuana-rescheduling-review-will-be-one-of-my-first-priorities-in-the-job/">examining the government’s pending marijuana rescheduling proposal would be “one of my first priorities” after taking office</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, former White House Press Secretary <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-will-not-legalize-marijuana-former-white-house-press-secretary-sean-spicer-says/">Sean Spicer predicted that Trump would not legalize marijuana</a>, though that is a separate issue from the current rescheduling proposal under consideration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a strategic consulting and research firm associated with Trump—Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, LLC—conducted a survey of registered voters that showed <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pollster-shows-that-republicans-are-even-more-supportive-of-state-marijuana-legalization-rights-than-voters-overall-are/">a majority of Republicans back a variety of cannabis reforms</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new political committee that shares the same treasurer as President Donald Trump&#8217;s own super PAC is pushing the president to follow through on rescheduling marijuana, releasing an ad that highlights his previous endorsement of the reform on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>The 30-second spot comes from the America First Agriculture Action Inc., a PAC that describes itself as &#8220;committed to establishing a clear, equitable, and unified legal framework for all Cannabis sativa L.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under President Trump, America is back. Trump&#8217;s delivered the largest tax cut in history—putting more money in our pockets and restored America&#8217;s economic dominance,&#8221; the ad, which is being targeted at multiple zip codes throughout Washington, D.C., says. &#8220;Promises made, promises kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s time to fulfill another promise from President Trump and reschedule cannabis, which supports over 400,000 jobs and creates billions of dollars in economic growth,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.america1stagriculture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAC&#8217;s</a> ad says. &#8220;Reschedule cannabis and stack another win, Mr. President.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe title="Roaring Back" width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAImxWG8s0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Notably, the treasurer of the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00906701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAC</a>, Charles Gantt, is the same person named as treasurer of Trump&#8217;s political committee, MAGA Inc., which <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-industry-political-committee-donated-1-million-to-trumps-pac-new-fec-filings-show/">recently reported receiving $1 million from a marijuana industry PAC</a> that&#8217;s supported by multiple major cannabis companies.</p>
<p>That committee, the American Rights and Reform PAC, separately released ads in May that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-industry-pac-attacks-biden-and-canada-in-new-ads-designed-to-appeal-to-trump/">attacked former President Joe Biden’s marijuana policy record</a> in an apparent attempt to push Trump to go further on the issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a post that recently circulated on social media appears to show that MAGA Inc., which is also referred to as also called Make America Great Again Inc., itself created an ad that touts Trump’s support for “commonsense reform” such as removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and letting states set their own policies.</p>
<p>The ad ends with the narrator saying “Donald Trump for president,” however, indicating that it may have been prepared prior to the 2024 election.</p>
<p>While Trump backed rescheduling, industry banking access and a Florida legalization ballot initiative on the campaign trail, he’s been publicly silent on the topic since taking office.</p>
<p>That said, The Wall Street Journal and CNN recently reported that administration is <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-says-hes-going-to-look-at-marijuana-as-white-house-chief-of-staff-receives-rescheduling-reports/">currently weighing whether to move forward with the marijuana rescheduling process</a>, with the president recently telling donors at a private fundraiser that “we need to look at” the issue.</p>
<p>The owner of the major gardening supply company Scotts Miracle-Gro recently said Trump has told him directly “multiple times” since taking office that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-privately-committed-to-reschedule-marijuana-multiple-times-since-taking-office-ceo-says/">he intends to see through the marijuana rescheduling process</a>.</p>
<p>Trump’s former acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) also recently predicted that the administration <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-former-dea-head-predicts-president-will-dig-in-to-marijuana-laws-and-figure-out-best-way-forward/">will soon “dig in” to the state-federal marijuana policy conflict</a>, emphasizing the need to “eliminate confusion, not create it” amid the rescheduling push.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Terrence Cole, who was sworn in last month as the new administrator of the DEA, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-rescheduling-not-included-in-new-dea-heads-strategic-priorities-despite-pledge-during-confirmation-hearing/">declined to include rescheduling on a list of “strategic priorities”</a> the agency that instead focused on anti-trafficking enforcement, Mexican cartels, the fentanyl supply chain, drug-fueled violence, cryptocurrency, the dark web and a host of other matters.</p>
<p>That’s despite the fact that Cole said during a confirmation hearing in April that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pick-to-lead-dea-says-marijuana-rescheduling-review-will-be-one-of-my-first-priorities-in-the-job/">examining the government’s pending marijuana rescheduling proposal would be “one of my first priorities” after taking office</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, former White House Press Secretary <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-will-not-legalize-marijuana-former-white-house-press-secretary-sean-spicer-says/">Sean Spicer predicted that Trump would not legalize marijuana</a>, though that is a separate issue from the current rescheduling proposal under consideration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a strategic consulting and research firm associated with Trump—Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, LLC—conducted a survey of registered voters that showed <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pollster-shows-that-republicans-are-even-more-supportive-of-state-marijuana-legalization-rights-than-voters-overall-are/">a majority of Republicans back a variety of cannabis reforms</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid a series of legal challenges, the Trump administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on the federal government&#8217;s ban on users of marijuana and other illegal drugs from owning firearms and uphold the prohibition, saying it is consistent with the 2nd Amendment.</p>
<p>To that end, the DOJ solicitor general is urging SCOTUS to hear one of five relevant cases to resolve conflicting lower court decisions on gun rights for cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>With the multiple competing legal cases resulting in differing rulings in federal appeals courts across the country, DOJ last week requested that SCOTUS review one in particular that it described as &#8220;archetypal&#8221; of the issue related to federal code 922(g)(3), which precludes users of unlawful drugs from having guns or ammo.</p>
<p>The case &#8220;presents an important Second Amendment issue that affects hundreds of prosecutions every year: whether the government may disarm individuals who habitually use unlawful drugs but are not necessarily under the influence while possessing a firearm,&#8221; U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said.</p>
<p>The solicitor general reiterated his position that, despite recent appeals court decisions calling into question the constitutionality of the firearms ban for people who use cannabis—even in compliance with state law—the restriction is nevertheless lawful.</p>
<p>Some lower courts have said the government’s blanket ban on gun and ammunition possession infringes on the Second Amendment—at least as applied to certain individual cases—because there’s no historical justification for such a broad restriction on an entire category of people.</p>
<p>But over recent years, various federal district and appeals courts have take differing approaches to the issue. As DOJ argued in its latest filing in the case, &#8220;the question presented is the subject of a multi-sided and growing circuit conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8220;The petition for a writ of certiorari [filed by Sauer in June] identified three sides of that conflict: The Seventh Circuit has upheld Section 922(g)(3); the Eighth Circuit has held it violates the Second Amendment unless the government can make a case-by-case showing justifying the drug user’s disarmament; and the Fifth Circuit has held that it generally violates the Second Amendment unless the drug user was intoxicated while possessing the firearm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then, the conflict has deepened,&#8221; it said, referring to several other cases on the issue that are pending before the high court. And DOJ wants SCOTUS to focus on one case in particular to resolve what it called a &#8220;four-way circuit conflict&#8221;: <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/letting-marijuana-users-have-guns-poses-a-clear-danger-trumps-solicitor-general-tells-supreme-court/"><em>U.S. v. Hemani</em></a>.</p>
<p>One reason DOJ could be focused on the justices taking up <em>Hemani</em> in particular is that the defendant in that case is not only a cannabis user but also a user of cocaine who’s sold drugs in the past, according to court findings, which could make him less sympathetic in the eyes of the court. Defendants in the other cases were merely found in possession of both a firearm and marijuana.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the defendant in <em>Hemani</em> argued in a brief last month that the high court should decline the case.</p>
<p>But in its reply brief submitted to SCOTUS this week, the Justice Department said that &#8220;this case is the best vehicle available.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has filed petitions for writs of certiorari in four other cases presenting the same question&#8230; As those petitions explain, this case presents the Second Amendment issue more cleanly than [three other cases pending before SCOTUS] and involves a more developed record&#8221; compared to a fourth.</p>
<p>DOJ also reiterated that, despite the respondents&#8217; argument about the widespread availability of marijuana in particular at the state level, &#8220;federal law still prohibits possessing marijuana, and federal law takes precedence over contrary state law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Section 922(g)(3) fits comfortably within this Nation’s tradition of firearm regulation,&#8221; it said under a section of the brief titled &#8220;Section 922(g)(3) Complies With The Second Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nine justices are set to privately discuss whether to take up <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1234.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemani</a></em> and other cannabis and gun rights cases in a private meeting next month. That includes the cases <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1247.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. v. Cooper</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1248.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. v. Daniels</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1249.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. v. Sam</a></em>. A separate case, <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1328.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. v. Baxter</a></em>, is also before the court and has received briefs under two separate <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24a1010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dockets</a>, but has not yet been scheduled for discussion at the September 29 meeting like the other cases.</p>
<p>In <em>Cooper</em>, an appeals court panel previously <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-appeals-court-says-constitution-doesnt-support-taking-guns-away-from-all-marijuana-users-categorically/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">dismissed a three-year prison sentence against the defendant, who was convicted for possession of a firearm while being an active user of marijuana</a>. The solicitor general last month asked that the court hold off on deciding whether to review that case until the <em>Hemani</em> dispute is resolved.</p>
<p>The <em>Baxter</em> case, meanwhile, involves a defendant found in possession of both a firearm and a bag of marijuana. The government charged him under 922(g)(3). DOJ had repeatedly asked the court for more time to decide whether to seek review of an opinion in that case from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which ruled the gun ban might be unconstitutional as applied to the defendant. In late June, Sauer asked the justices to decide <em>Hemani</em> first and let that ruling control the decision in <em>Baxter</em>, similar to <em>Cooper</em>.</p>
<p>A number of federal courts in recent months have cast doubt on the legality of 922(g)(3), finding generally that while the ban on gun ownership among drug users may not be entirely unconstitutional, there’s scant historical precedent for such a broad restriction of Second Amendment rights on an entire a category of people.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/courts-grapple-with-constitutional-attacks-on-law-barring-marijuana-users-from-gun-ownership-congressional-researchers-note/">recent report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) explained the current legal landscape</a>, a growing number of federal courts are now “finding constitutional problems in the application of at least some parts” of the firearms prohibition.</p>
<p>In a ruling last month, for instance, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/appeals-court-vacates-conviction-over-marijuana-users-gun-ownership-noting-lower-court-didnt-find-his-use-caused-a-threat/">vacated a defendant’s conviction and remanded the case back to a district court</a>, noting that a retrial before a jury may be necessary to determine whether cannabis in fact caused the defendant to be dangerous or pose a credible threat to others.</p>
<p>The new Eighth Circuit opinion appears to differ from a recent Third Circuit ruling in that the new decision says that not every application of 922(g)(3) “require[s] an individualized factual determination,” explaining that such determinations wouldn’t be necessary if the government could demonstrate that a particular drug made an entire class of users dangerous.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-court-upholds-gun-ban-for-marijuana-users-but-requires-individualized-judgments-to-determine-dangerousness/">Third Circuit earlier this month said in a published opinion that district courts must make “individualized judgments” to determine whether 922(g)(3) is constitutional</a> as applied to particular defendants.</p>
<p>The appeals panel ruled that while a person “need not have harmed someone, threatened harm, or otherwise acted dangerously to justify his disarmament,” the history of gun laws in the country requires that “district courts must make individualized judgments and conclude that disarming a drug user is needed to address a risk that he would pose a physical danger to others.”</p>
<p>Judges in that case noted that historical restrictions on gun ownership under “drunkenness and lunacy laws” in the U.S. “were still always based on an ‘individualized assessment’ rather than a categorical judgment.”</p>
<p>In 2024, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in <em>U.S. v. Rahimi</em>, a case having to do with firearm possession among people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. Justices subsequently remanded a number of pending cases back to lower courts for reconsideration, including <em>U.S. v. Daniels</em>, which centered on the federal gun prohibition for cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>When the <em>Daniels</em> case was first heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, judges declared the gun restriction unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Fifth Circuit, the appeals court in a January opinion again took issue with the statute, explaining that while 922(g)(3) wasn’t unconstitutional on its face, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-court-reaffirms-that-ban-on-gun-ownership-for-people-who-occasionally-use-marijuana-is-unconstitutional/">it <em>was</em> unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who was only an occasional cannabis user</a>.</p>
<p>The Fifth Circuit’s <em>Daniels</em> ruling came on the heels of a string of <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-court-reaffirms-that-ban-on-gun-ownership-for-people-who-occasionally-use-marijuana-is-unconstitutional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">other judicial decisions casting doubt on the legality of the ban</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a federal judge in Rhode Island <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/another-federal-judge-rules-against-the-governments-ban-on-gun-ownership-by-marijuana-consumers/" data-google-interstitial="false">ruled that the ban was unconstitutional as applied to two defendants</a>, writing that the government failed to establish that the “sweeping” prohibition against gun ownership by marijuana users was grounded in historical precedent.</p>
<p>A federal judge in El Paso separately ruled late last year that the government’s ongoing <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-judge-in-texas-rules-that-ban-on-gun-ownership-by-marijuana-user-is-unconstitutional-as-applied/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">ban on gun ownership by habitual marijuana users is unconstitutional</a> in the case of a defendant who earlier pleaded guilty to the criminal charge. The court allowed the man to withdraw the plea and ordered that the indictment against him be dismissed.</p>
<p>Another panel of judges, on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-appeals-court-hears-challenge-to-gun-ban-for-marijuana-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">heard oral arguments in November</a> in the government’s appeal of <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/justice-department-appeals-federal-court-decision-that-struck-down-gun-rights-ban-for-marijuana-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">a district court ruling that deemed the gun ban unconstitutional</a>.</p>
<p>In a number of the ongoing cases, DOJ has argued that the prohibition on gun ownership by marijuana users <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/supreme-courts-domestic-violence-ruling-underscores-why-marijuana-users-shouldnt-own-guns-doj-tells-federal-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">is also supported by the <em>Rahimi </em>decision</a> that upheld the government’s ability to limit the Second Amendment rights of people with domestic violence restraining orders.</p>
<p>DOJ has made such arguments, for example, in favor of the firearms ban in a case in a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/doj-doubles-down-on-claim-that-medical-marijuana-patients-endanger-public-safety-if-they-own-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a>. In that matter, a group of Florida medical cannabis patients contends that their Second Amendment rights are being violated because they cannot lawfully buy firearms so long as they are using cannabis as medicine, despite acting in compliance with state law.</p>
<p>DOJ under President Joe Biden consistently argued that medical marijuana patients who possess firearms “endanger public safety,” “pose a greater risk of suicide” and are more likely to commit crimes “to fund their drug habit.”</p>
<p>It remains unclear how the Trump administration will approach the cases. At a NRA conference in 2023, Trump suggested there <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-suggests-genetically-engineered-marijuana-may-be-causing-mass-shootings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">might be a link between the use of “genetically engineered” marijuana and mass shootings</a>. He listed a number of controversial and unproven factors that he said at the time he would direct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate as possibly causing the ongoing scourge of mass shooting afflicting the country.</p>
<p>“We have to look at whether common psychiatric drugs, as well as genetically engineered cannabis and other narcotics, are causing psychotic breaks” that lead to gun violence, he said.</p>
<p>DOJ has claimed in multiple federal cases over the past several years that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-appeals-court-rules-that-gun-ban-for-marijuana-consumers-is-unconstitutional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">the statute banning cannabis consumers from owning or possessing guns</a> is constitutional because it’s consistent with the nation’s history of disarming “dangerous” individuals.</p>
<p>In 2023, for example, the Justice Department told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that historical precedent “comfortably” supports the restriction. Cannabis consumers with guns pose a unique danger to society, the Biden administration claimed, in part because they’re <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bidens-justice-department-says-marijuana-consumers-are-unlikely-to-store-guns-properly-in-latest-defense-of-federal-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">“unlikely” to store their weapon properly</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Biden’s son Hunter was convicted by a federal jury of violating statute by buying and possessing a gun while an active user of crack cocaine. Two Republican congressmen challenged the basis of that conviction, with one pointing out that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-congressman-says-millions-of-marijuana-users-own-guns-and-shouldnt-face-prosecution-like-hunter-biden-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">there are “millions of marijuana users” who own guns</a> but should not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The situation has caused confusion among medical marijuana patients, state lawmakers and advocacy groups, among others. The <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/nra-says-federal-ban-on-marijuana-amid-state-level-legalization-has-created-confusing-legal-landscape-for-gun-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">National Rifle Association’s (NRA) lobbying arm said recently that the court rulings on the cannabis and guns issue</a> have “led to a confusing regulatory landscape” that have impacted Americans’ Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>“Marijuana use is no longer limited to the domain of indigenous religious customs or youth-oriented counterculture and now includes a wide variety of people who use it for medicinal or recreational reasons,” said the advocacy group, which does not have an official stance on cannabis policy generally. “Many of these individuals are otherwise law-abiding and productive members of their communities and want to exercise their right to keep and bear arms.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some states have passed their own laws either further restricting or attempting to preserve gun rights as they relate to marijuana. Recently a Pennsylvania lawmaker introduced a bill meant to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/pennsylvania-gop-senators-bill-would-let-medical-marijuana-patients-get-gun-carry-permits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">remove state barriers to medical marijuana patients carrying firearms</a>.</p>
<p>Colorado activists also attempted to qualify an initiative for November’s ballot that would have protected the Second Amendment rights of marijuana consumers in that state, but <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/colorado-initiative-on-marijuana-and-concealed-carry-firearm-permits-fails-to-qualify-for-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">the campaign’s signature-gathering drive ultimately fell short</a>.</p>
<p>As 2024 drew to a close, the <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/kentucky-residents-who-participate-in-states-new-medical-marijuana-program-will-be-ineligible-to-own-guns-feds-warn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">ATF issued a warning to Kentucky residents</a> that, if they choose to participate in <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/kentucky-could-legalize-recreational-marijuana-if-new-medical-program-works-well-governor-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">the state’s medical marijuana program that’s set to launch imminently</a>, they will be prohibited from buying or possessing firearms under federal law.</p>
<p>The official said that while people who already own firearms aren’t “expected to” turn them over if they become state-legal cannabis patients, those who “wish to follow federal law and not be in violation of it” must “make the decision to divest themselves of those firearms.”</p>
<p>Since then, bipartisan state lawmakers have introduced <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bipartisan-kentucky-lawmakers-push-congress-to-protect-medical-marijuana-patients-gun-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">legislation that would urge Kentucky’s representatives in Congress to amend federal law</a> to clarify that users of medical marijuana may legally possess firearms, though no action has since been taken on that bill.</p>
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said in January that he supported the legislature’s effort to urge the state’s congressional delegation to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/bipartisan-kentucky-lawmakers-push-congress-to-protect-medical-marijuana-patients-gun-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false">call for federal reforms to protect the Second Amendment rights of medical marijuana patients</a>, but the governor added that he’d like to see even more sweeping change on the federal level.</p>
<p>“I think the right way to deal with that is not just to focus on that issue, but to change the schedule of marijuana,” Beshear said at a press conference. “What we need to change is the overall marijuana policy by the federal government.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;I think that there’s a sincere appetite from enough members on the council that recognize there’s some problems that need to be addressed with this industry.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>By Rebecca Rivas, Missouri Independent</strong></p>
<p>A final vote on a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/battle-between-intoxicating-hemp-and-marijuana-industries-picks-up-in-st-louis/">St. Louis County bill to regulate intoxicating hemp products</a> stalled out Tuesday night after about a dozen business owners and lobbyists opposed it at the county council meeting.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy, told The Independent on Wednesday morning that she plans on revisiting the bill’s language and will hold a public hearing no later than the end of September.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the final version looks like yet,” Clancy said, “but I think that there’s a sincere appetite from enough members on the council that recognize there’s some problems that need to be addressed with this industry and some of the products on the market.”</p>
<p>In January, Clancy proposed a bill to prohibit products like beverages and edibles that are often labeled as “hemp-derived Delta-9” or “Delta-8” from being sold outside of marijuana dispensaries.</p>
<p>If enacted, the bill would effectively ban those products in Missouri’s largest county.</p>
<p>The county’s health department would be tasked with enforcement, including seizing and destroying the products.</p>
<p>Brian Riegel, owner of two Missouri intoxicating-hemp companies, said Tuesday that he encourages the council to regulate the products but not ban them.</p>
<p>“We can maybe use this platform…to encourage the state to regulate this in the proper manner, rather than outlaw it,” Riegel said. “This is going to drive a black market bigger than we’ve ever seen because it’s already here.”</p>
<p>For the past three years, Missouri lawmakers have attempted to pass legislation that would put hemp-derived THC products under the same regulatory framework as marijuana. The proposals were met by fierce opposition, particularly from associations representing convenience stores, hemp companies and veterans.</p>
<p>This past spring, Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance offered a proposal that carved out an exception for low-dose THC beverages, which have been sold in Missouri’s bars and liquor stores for seven years. It still required things like high-dose gummies, THCA flower and vapes to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries.</p>
<p>Schroer’s bill was filibustered by state Sen. Karla May and other St. Louis Democratic senators, who argued that it would create a monopoly for the marijuana industry and harm small businesses.</p>
<p>Hemp naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. But that potency can be increased with some science.</p>
<p>While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products have been completely unregulated by any governmental agency since 2018—when Congress passed a Farm Bill that legalized hemp.</p>
<p>The St. Louis City NAACP submitted a letter to the council stating that its members “stand in solidarity” with May as she opposed legislation that had the same language as Clancy’s.</p>
<p>“While we recognize efforts to promote public safety, we are gravely concerned that this bill will disproportionately impact small, often minority-owned businesses—vape shops, convenience stores, and independent retailers—that have legally entered the hemp market under the protections of the federal 2018 Farm Bill,” the NAACP letter states.</p>
<p>When Clancy held the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25997307-bill-no-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> from going to a vote Tuesday night, she said the goal is to protect public health. But she said she understands “there’s still some discussions that need to happen.”</p>
<p>She told The Independent last month that she’s most concerned about the edibles that look like candy and are sold in places children can access. Her bill doesn’t ban non-intoxicating products, like CBD seltzers or lotions, she said.</p>
<p>Several people testified Tuesday that Clancy’s bill would put companies out of business. Clancy told The Independent Wednesday those allegations are “unfounded.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have data to support that,” she said. “A lot of these companies, what they’re not saying is that they’ve existed long before the 2018 Farm Bill.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Our liquor stores never fail compliance tests, whether for tobacco or liquor. We feel we can do the same thing within the cannabis industry.”</em></p>
<p class="byline"><strong>By Brian Arola, MinnPost</strong></p>
<p>As some Minnesota cities fret over regulating newly legalized and normalized marijuana sales, others see an opportunity.</p>
<p>Elk River is among 13 Minnesota cities considering opening municipally owned cannabis stores. They would be blazing new trails in this regard, as government-run pot shops aren’t currently in use anywhere else in the country. City Administrator Cal Portner talks about Elk River’s approach as making the most of a situation.</p>
<p>“I don’t sense that our council is enthusiastic about the law to legalize, but they’re accepting of reality,” he said.</p>
<p>Revenue potential from cannabis sales, and how it can be put to use in the community, is part of the appeal. Assuring compliance is also part of it.</p>
<p>“Our liquor stores never fail compliance tests, whether for tobacco or liquor,” Portner said. “We feel we can do the same thing within the cannabis industry.”</p>
<p><!-- RTT removed image (2205641) --></p>
<p>The full list of cities applying to run municipal cannabis stores, according to the state’s Office of Cannabis Management (OCM), includes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Anoka</li>
<li>Blaine</li>
<li>Buffalo</li>
<li>Byron</li>
<li>Elk River</li>
<li>Grand Rapids</li>
<li>Lauderdale</li>
<li>Mounds View</li>
<li>St. Anthony Village</li>
<li>St. Joseph</li>
<li>Osseo</li>
<li>Owatonna</li>
<li>Wyoming</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liquor munis as a model</h3>
<p>The only state with any track record of a government-run cannabis shop is Washington, where a store in North Bonneville <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/inside-americas-only-government-run-pot-dispensary-629436/">opened in 2015</a> and operated until 2021. Where Minnesota differed from Washington and other legalized-cannabis states was in the defined path it created for cities to pursue cannabis munis.</p>
<p>Despite being a new concept, Minnesota’s established muni model for liquor, also novel nationally, gives Portner confidence in the feasibility. Cities have entrepreneurial experience on their sides, he said, including already selling hemp-based THC products in liquor stores.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>We’ve had practice time basically to understand the products and understand the customer service side of it,” Portner said.</p>
<p>Municipal liquor sales add nearly $1 million to Elk River’s annual budget.</p>
<p><!-- RTT removed image (2205638) --></p>
<p>The city’s two liquor munis keep profits home, Portner said, rather than going to corporations based out of town or state.</p>
<p>“We’re among the top Minnesota liquor store operations within the state and are proud of that,” he said. “It puts a lot of money back in our community.”</p>
<p>Minnesota had 176 cities running liquor munis as of 2023, according to the <a href="https://www.auditor.state.mn.us/news/updates/press-releases-articles/2025/state-auditor-blaha-to-release-2023-municipal-liquor-store-report-april-2-2025/">latest annual report</a> on them by the Office of the State Auditor. Most munis come out ahead, combining for $31.6 million in net profits in 2023. Elk River generated $962,190 of it. Buffalo brought in $710,505. St. Anthony Village was $426,385 in the positive.</p>
<p>Even modest net profits, say $10,000 per year, are good deals for small towns, said Paul Kaspszak, executive director of the Minnesota Municipal Beverage Association.</p>
<p>“You could say it’s not very much money, but there’s nothing else happening in that community that will generate that $10,000,” he said.</p>
<p>In his hypothetical, 100 homeowners in the community could be looking at $100 in savings on their property taxes. In Elk River, Portner said it might take an additional 45 businesses in town to generate enough property taxes to equal net profits from city liquor sales.</p>
<p>Cannabis sales projections are highly speculative, but Portner said it’ll likely take a couple years to turn profits. Between investments in capital, inventory, marketing and education, an estimate prepared for the city in January put first-year losses at $184,698.</p>
<p>All but 18 of the state’s liquor munis are in Greater Minnesota. For cannabis muni applicants, seven of the 13 are in the seven-county Twin Cities metro area.</p>
<p>St. Joseph’s mayor, Adam Scepaniak, and other officials from cities on the list confirmed they were still waiting on OCM approval to get their cannabis licenses as of last week. Plans are taking shape in the interim, with St. Joseph, Elk River and others looking into possible locations for cannabis retail.</p>
<p>Elk River is considering a building to house both cannabis sales and one of its two municipal liquor stores. Northbound would remain the name of the liquor muni, while the cannabis side would assume the name Cannabound.</p>
<p>Owatonna applied for a muni cannabis permit on March 13, said Deanna Sheely, the city’s communications manager, in an email. No decisions will be made on it until the license process is completed.</p>
<p>When Byron moved forward with an application in February, City Administrator Al Roder noted it didn’t bind the city to the idea.</p>
<p>“Applying for the license and even receiving one, doesn’t lock us into going ahead with a dispensary,” he stated on the city’s Facebook post. “But the window to apply for a license is very small.”</p>

<p><!-- RTT removed image (2205639) --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wide spectrum of attitudes toward cannabis industry</h3>
<p>As opposed to the 13 cities exploring cannabis munis, Albert Lea sits on the opposite end of the spectrum. A <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/greater-minnesota/2025/07/albert-lea-at-odds-with-state-law-after-city-council-denies-cannabis-license/">City Council vote last week</a> stopped a privately run cannabis store from opening—an apparent violation of state statute. An update by the city posted on Facebook afterward described the vote being based on “questions of enforcement, liability and responsibility” necessitating further review.</p>
<p>Adopting zoning restrictions on where cannabis businesses are allowed, a lever given to cities in state law, is more of a middle-ground strategy. Combined with caps on the maximum number of businesses allowed to operate, almost all cities implemented some form of this approach or another.</p>
<p>The cap is an area of contrast between the state’s cannabis and liquor muni regulations. A city with muni liquor doesn’t need to allow private liquor stores within its limits, but it can’t monopolize cannabis in the same way. Muni cannabis stores don’t count toward the cap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration is currently weighing whether to move forward with the marijuana rescheduling process initiated under the Biden administration, with the president recently telling donors that &#8220;we need to look at&#8221; the issue, according to reports.</p>
<p>“That’s something we’re going to look at,&#8221; Trump said at a $1 million-a-plate fundraising dinner at his Bedminster, New Jersey club recently, according to CNN and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The comments come as cannabis industry observers have waited for signals on whether the administration will follow through on the president&#8217;s campaign pledge to reschedule marijuana.</p>
<p>Trulieve CEO Kim Rivers was in attendance at the dinner where Trump briefly discussed marijuana this month, the Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-marijuana-federal-drug-classification-01a73b8c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNN that &#8220;all policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered&#8221; when it comes to marijuana.</p>
<p>“The only interest guiding the president’s policy decision is what is in the best interest of the American people,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/trump-marijuana-reclassify-dea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>According to CNN, there is dissent within the administration when it comes to cannabis, with some advisors urging the president to take action on the popular campaign pledge and others &#8220;cautioning that the moral and legal ramifications of loosening marijuana restrictions could outweigh the potential gains and even backfire politically.&#8221;</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has requested key agencies to submit their positions on cannabis rescheduling, with CNN citing two sources who said those responses &#8220;now sit in a report on her desk&#8221; after having been compiled by the Domestic Policy Council.</p>
<p>While Trump endorsed rescheduling cannabis—as well as industry banking access and a state-level legalization initiative in Florida—on the campaign trail last year, he&#8217;s been silent about the issue since taking office for his second term.</p>
<p>Newly published Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that a marijuana industry-funded political committee <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-industry-political-committee-donated-1-million-to-trumps-pac-new-fec-filings-show/">donated $1 million to Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC</a> in the first half of this year. Trulieve, whose CEO Rivers attended the recent dinner where Trump discussed cannabis, contributed $250,000 to the industry PAC.</p>
<p>The PAC also reported an expenditure $120,500 to a strategic consulting and research firm associated with Trump, Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, LLC, for “legal” services. The same firm conducted a survey of registered voters that showed <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pollster-shows-that-republicans-are-even-more-supportive-of-state-marijuana-legalization-rights-than-voters-overall-are/">a majority of Republicans back a variety of cannabis reforms</a> that is promoted on the PAC’s website.</p>
<p>The owner of the major gardening supply company Scotts Miracle-Gro recently said Trump has told him directly “multiple times” since taking office that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-privately-committed-to-reschedule-marijuana-multiple-times-since-taking-office-ceo-says/">he intends to see through the marijuana rescheduling process</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier FEC records also previously showed that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-companies-donated-at-least-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration-new-federal-records-show/">Trulieve and Curaleaf contributed a total of $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee</a> following his election last November.</p>
<p>Trump’s former acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) also recently predicted that the administration <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-former-dea-head-predicts-president-will-dig-in-to-marijuana-laws-and-figure-out-best-way-forward/">will soon “dig in” to the state-federal marijuana policy conflict</a>, emphasizing the need to “eliminate confusion, not create it” amid the rescheduling push.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Terrence Cole, who was sworn in last month as the new administrator of the DEA, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-rescheduling-not-included-in-new-dea-heads-strategic-priorities-despite-pledge-during-confirmation-hearing/">declined to include rescheduling on a list of “strategic priorities”</a> the agency that instead focused on anti-trafficking enforcement, Mexican cartels, the fentanyl supply chain, drug-fueled violence, cryptocurrency, the dark web and a host of other matters.</p>
<p>That’s despite the fact that Cole said during a confirmation hearing in April that <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trumps-pick-to-lead-dea-says-marijuana-rescheduling-review-will-be-one-of-my-first-priorities-in-the-job/">examining the government’s pending marijuana rescheduling proposal would be “one of my first priorities” after taking office</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, former White House Press Secretary <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-will-not-legalize-marijuana-former-white-house-press-secretary-sean-spicer-says/">Sean Spicer predicted that Trump would not legalize marijuana</a>, though that is a separate issue from the current rescheduling proposal under consideration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Petitioners&#8230;do not have standing to bring a claim individually related to the patient registry.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>By Alander Rocha, Alabama Reflector</strong></p>
<p>A state judge Monday dismissed a <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/alabama-judge-will-hear-lawsuit-from-parents-over-states-medical-marijuana-delays/">lawsuit from parents of children who are potentially eligible to receive medical cannabis</a> who wanted to force the state to create a patient registry.</p>
<p>Montgomery County Circuit Judge James Anderson wrote in the order that the plaintiffs lacked the legal standing to bring the claim.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, parents Dustin Chandler, Cristina Cain, Catherine Hall, Megan Jackson and Kari Forsyth, filed a lawsuit in April to direct  “the State of Alabama to uphold the Compassion Act’s requirement that the commission establish a patient and caregiver registry and to secure performance by defendants of this duty owed to the public.”</p>
<p>“The identity of qualified patients and caregivers will not be known, and the patient registry populated, until the [Alabama Board of Medical Examiners] authorizes physicians to identify and recommend medical cannabis and provide the necessary information regarding the qualified patients,” the dismissal order stated.</p>
<p>Anderson in his order also said that plaintiffs weren’t the right party to sue on behalf of the state, and that the lawsuit would have to have “participation or consent of the attorney general of Alabama.”</p>
<p>“Petitioners cannot demonstrate standing to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction because they are not the proper party to institute a proceeding for mandamus in the name of the State in this matter and because they do not have standing to bring a claim individually related to the patient registry,” the order stated.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left with the parents’ lawyer.</p>
<p>John McMillan, director of the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC), said in a phone interview Thursday that he was pleased with the court’s ruling, saying that this lawsuit could have been resolved with “a phone call to our office.”</p>
<p>“Until we get licenses issued in these other categories, [doctors] can’t start certifying patients and putting them in the registry,” McMillan said.</p>
<p>A motion to dismiss filed by AMCC stated that the AMCC had already established a patient registry and was maintaining it. The reason it was not populated, according to the commission, was due to a series of lawsuits filed by “disappointed license applicants” that resulted in delays due to restraining orders and injunctions.</p>
<p>The AMCC argued that those delays prevented them from issuing licenses, which is a prerequisite for the Board of Medical Examiners (BME) to certify physicians. Without certified physicians, patients cannot be registered.</p>
<p>The BME is responsible for certifying physicians to recommend medical cannabis, and physician certifications can only be issued after the AMCC has granted at least one license to a cultivator, processor, transporter and dispensary, or one integrated facility.</p>
<p>The petitioners’ response to the motion to dismiss countered that the commission’s website “expressively contradicts” their claim of a functioning registry, and that “the hold up with the medical board’s requirement is on the Commission.”</p>
